# Cursor Rules

## General
- Follow project ESLint rules and Prettier defaults (single quotes).
- Keep to NestJS and TypeScript best practices.

## Naming
- Interfaces/classes: PascalCase.
- Variables/functions: camelCase.
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

## Dependency Injection
- Use constructor injection; mark dependencies as `private readonly` in services/guards.

## Async/Await
- Prefer async/await over Promise chains.
- Do not return `undefined` from handlers/controllers.
- Always handle errors (try/catch or `.catch`).

## Error Handling
- Provide meaningful error messages.

## Asset Management
- When adding assets, update `nest-cli.json` so they copy to `dist`.

## Code Quality
- Guard against null/undefined; use optional chaining and nullish coalescing when suitable.
- Ensure async methods handle errors and return meaningful responses.

## Throw helpers
- Use global `throwIf`/`throwUnless` (from `src/shared/utils/throw.util.ts`) instead of importing per file.
